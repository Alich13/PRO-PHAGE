###PROPHAGE

##Introduction

PRPOPHAGE is a web tool intended for protein sequence analysis.

It is a tool that automates and facilitates the analysis of the primary sequences of Bacteriophage proteins that combines multiple alignment with different secondary structure prediction methods and other useful methods which are integrated into a graphical user interface allowing the handling of amino acids sequences and data in a very interactive and convenient manner.
